       <div id="heating">IBM has come a long way from its humble beginings. It
       was founded in 1911, under the name of Computer Tabulating Recording
       Company.
       In 1925, They would change their name to International Business
       Machines. Its early accomplishments included helping in World War II
       by keeping statistcs. These early machines used punch cards to record
       informaton. In 1944, They would develop their first computer 
       known as the Automated Sequence Controlled Calculate, also known as the
       Mark I. This machine was used by the Navy to calculate gun 
       trajectories.</div>

       In the 1950's, IBM began producing computers primarily for the
       government and business. THese computers were extremely large and used
       for basic operations.They were not yet available for the general public.
       In 1980, IBM made a deal with MicroSoft that would change the 
       computer industry forever.Microsoft would put their operation system on
       IBM computers, changing the way computers were used. A year later
       in 1981, IBM would release their first ever personal computer called
       Personal Computer 5150. Eventually, many personal computer clones would
       be released in the decade, and Microsoft would provide operating systems
       for them. This would lead to a decline in IBM's monopoly on the 
       personal computer industry.</div>

       <div id="about">IBM also pioneered many other technologies. in 1996,
       scientits at IBM created Deep Blue, a chess playing computer that would
       eventually win 
       the world championship in chess. The architecture in Deep Blue would go
       on to help the computer industry in other fields such as 
       data analysis and artificial intelligence. It also showed the potential
       of human and artificial intelligence interaction. Ultimately, 
       Deep Blue was retired  by IBM. It inspired other projects at IBM such as
       the Watson project, a robot that played Jeopardy. The implications 
       of the Deep Blue project can still be seen today, as more complex and
       powerful computers are emerging.</div>
