       <div id="heating">In 1990, The company's board approves a new strategy
       for IBM. The corporation that was famous for business machines set out
       to become "a world-class 
       services company." This was primarily done to shift away from
       competitors in the Personal Computer industry such as Compaq and Dell,
       who were making
       significant gains using Microsoft's operating system. IBM's shift to a
       service based business would differ from their previous model greatly.

       <div id="cooling">IBMÂ’s traditional sales force was product-focused &
       organized by geography. Since services customers increasingly demanded
       IT vendors to be industry 
       savvy, IBM trained its sales force accordingly. This led to a
       reorganization of sales by industry, creation of a new role for services
       brand 
       specialists to feed opportunities to the services group, & development
       of a consultative sales approach. The company also redeveloped its
       channel 
       partner program to target small & mid-size businesses with sales &
       distribution processes. In 2005, IBM sold its hardware buiness to Lenovo
       who still
       uses many IBM brand names for product recognition.</div>

       <div id="about">IBM has been around almost decade & like any company
       with such longevity, IBM has had to adapt to a constant, changing
       markets. IBM has reduced its 
       dependence on hardware & has repositioned itself in software & supply
       chain services as a world leader. IBM has reinvented itself as a global
       company,
        who expands into 160 countries. IBM was able to effectively shift
