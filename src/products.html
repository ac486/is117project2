       <div id="heating">IBM's original products in the computing world were
       large mainframe computers used by governments and corporations to
       perform calculations. In 1980,
       They would release the Personal Computer 5150 which was their first
       computer made available to the public. It was sold at a retail price of
       $1565. 
       IBM modeled its marketing strategy and pricing after Apple's personal
       computer.The Personal Computer 5150 was large, featured a floppy disk
       drive and 
       a low amount of RAM. However, the PC as it was known, was extremely
       successful and would set the standard for Personal Computers.</div>

       <div id="cooling">Another innovative product produced by IBM was the
       ThinkPad, one of the earliest laptop computers. The ThinkPad was
       developed in 1991. It was built to 
       be reliant and resilient. The ThinkPad also featured a Trackpoint
       pointing device in the center of the keyboard as a substitution for the
       mouse. The
       ThinkPad would become a success and receive many awards for its design
       and quality. It was one of IBM's last big hardware successes before its
       shift
       to a service based company.</div>
